// this is how to push a local branch straight to a remote master
git push origin develop:master
git push <remote> <local branch name>:<remote branch to push into>

git branch development
git add *
git commit -m "My initial commit message"
git push -u origin development

git checkout master 
git merge development
git push -u origin master 

=========BETTER METHOD ======
(on branch development)$ git merge master
(resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)
git checkout master
git merge development (there won't be any conflicts now)
